				<p>Now you must have seen a gas stove at your home, that's basically a circular hollow cylinder with a bunch of holes in it and you pump in a flammable gas and light it on fire. So you basically create a circle of bunsen burners. So what we have built is a bigger version of that only. A hollow cuboid chamber. What's really interesting is to play some sound into the chamber and you could actually create standing waves i:e there are areas there are patterns of the vibration of the air where there is lot of vibration in some parts and not much vibration in other parts, now that affects the flow rate of gas inside the chamber so it affects the heights of those flames, so basically you can visualize the sound waves or the standing waves.It may sound simple and easy but just imagine you can see what you have never seen before i:e sound waves. It's basically a 2-Dimensional version of Rubens tube i:e a whole plane of bunsen burners.What you may have seen in the videos are 1936 flames coming out of 1936 no of holes that is on this flame-board.The pressure variation from the sound waves interfare with the flow rate of the LPG gas that that we pump into this flame-board.The result is the bright flames dancing to the sound of music. sound waves cannot be seen through our naked eyes so what basically the crux of this project is that the flames act as the proxy for the air. The use of this pyro board is to demonstrate or to visualize the amazing standing waves or sound waves.What inspired me to build this product was that I have an incredible passion for music and no one has ever seen the sound waves. So here it is. This revolutionary product lets us see the sound waves by using fire as a proxy for air.</p></div>

				<div class="content2"><h1>OLEDs</h1><p>An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.</p></div>
